# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project transforms the traditional 2D Tic Tac Toe game into an engaging, visually appealing experience. It features a single-player mode where the user (playing as "X") competes against an AI opponent (playing as "O"). The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on a futuristic 3D aesthetic and user-friendly functionality.
